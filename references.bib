              a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures,
              implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support
              formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
              infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the
              development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
              consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment
              that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses
              and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse
              populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of
              examples that provide new insights about the history of human
              admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of
              admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population
              related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other
              related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the
              Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between
              Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of
              Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from

  abstract  = "Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by
               examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets
               of populations. A useful methodological framework for this
               purpose isF-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between
               sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test
               simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between
               populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and
               population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be
               interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new
               interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that
               the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general
               properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas
               applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results
               are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under
               different models of population structure and show how population
               substructure complicates inference. The results lead to
               simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace
               F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for
               estimating population divergence.",

  abstract = "The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although
              Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to
              east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific
              Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the
              draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual
              (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth
              of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern
              human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome
              belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high
              frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European
              hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to
              modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native
              American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that
              MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically
              closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close
              affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related
              to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly
              distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore,
              we estimate that 14 to 38\% of Native American ancestry may
              originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is
              likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American
              ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the
              diversification of Native American populations in the New World.
              Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors
              could explain why several crania from the First Americans have
              been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do
              not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another
              south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately
              17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures
              as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by
              humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal
              that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native
              Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as
              commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First
              Americans.",

              makeup of northern Europe was shaped by migrations from Siberia
              that began at least 3500 years ago. This Siberian ancestry was
              subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region,
              particularly into populations speaking Uralic languages today.
              Additionally, we show that ancestors of modern Saami inhabited a

  abstract  = "Several methods have been proposed to test for introgression
               across genomes. One method tests for a genome-wide excess of
               shared derived alleles between taxa using Patterson's D
               statistic, but does not establish which loci show such an excess
               or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral
               population structure. Several recent studies have extended the
               use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions,
               rather than genome-wide. Here, we use simulations and
               whole-genome data from Heliconius butterflies to investigate the
               behavior of D in small genomic regions. We find that D is
               unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when
               effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster
               in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we
               propose a related statistic ƒ(d), a modified version of a
               statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide
               fraction of admixture. ƒ(d) is not subject to the same biases as
               D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci. Finally, we
               show that both D and ƒ(d) outliers tend to cluster in regions of
               low absolute divergence (d(XY)), which can confound a recently
               proposed test for differentiating introgression from shared

  abstract = "We sequenced the genomes of a ∼7,000-year-old farmer from Germany
              and eight ∼8,000-year-old hunter-gatherers from Luxembourg and
              Sweden. We analysed these and other ancient genomes with 2,345
              contemporary humans to show that most present-day Europeans
              derive from at least three highly differentiated populations:
              west European hunter-gatherers, who contributed ancestry to all
              Europeans but not to Near Easterners; ancient north Eurasians
              related to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians, who contributed to both
              Europeans and Near Easterners; and early European farmers, who
              were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west
              European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these
              populations' deep relationships and show that early European
              farmers had ∼44\% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population
              that split before the diversification of other non-African
              lineages.",
