              levels of gene flow from DNA sequence data. One method is based
              on estimating FST from frequencies at polymorphic sites, treating
              each site as a separate locus. The other method is based on
              computing the minimum number of migration events consistent with
              the gene tree inferred from their sequences. We compared the
              performance of these two methods on data that were generated by a
              computer simulation program that assumed the infinite sites model
              of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We
              found that in general when there is no recombination, the
              cladistic method performed better than FST while the reverse was
              true for rates of recombination similar to those found in
              eukaryotic nuclear genes, although FST performed better for all
              recombination rates for very low levels of migration (Nm = 0.1).",

  abstract = "A moment estimator of, the coancestry coefficient for alleles
              within a population, was described by Weir \& Cockerham in 1984
              (100) and is still widely cited. The estimate is used by
              population geneticists to characterize population structure, by
              ecologists to estimate migration rates, by animal breeders to
              describe genetic variation, and by forensic scientists to
              quantify the strength of matching DNA profiles. This review
              extends the work of Weir \& Cockerham by allowing different
              levels of coancestry for different populations, and by allowing
              non-zero coancestries between pairs of populations. All estimates
              are relative to the average value of theta between pairs of
              populations. Moment estimates for within- and between-population
              theta values are likely to have large sampling variances,
              although these may be reduced by combining information over loci.
              Variances also decrease with the numbers of alleles at a locus,
              and with the numbers of populations sampled. This review also
              extends the work of Weir \& Cockerham by employing maximum
              likelihood methods under the assumption that allele frequencies
              follow the normal distribution over populations. For the case of
              equal theta values within populations and zero theta values
              between populations, the maximum likelihood estimate is the same
              as that given by Robertson \& Hill in 1984 (70). The review
              concludes by relating functions of theta values to times of
              population divergence under a pure drift model.",

  abstract = "Population mixture is an important process in biology. We present
              a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures,
              implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support
              formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
              infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the
              development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
              consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment
              that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses
              and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse

              examples that provide new insights about the history of human
              admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of
              admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population

              related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the
              Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between
              Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of
              Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from
              Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean

  abstract  = "Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by
               examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets
               of populations. A useful methodological framework for this
               purpose isF-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between
               sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test
               simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between
               populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and
               population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be
               interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new
               interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that
               the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general
               properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas
               applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results
               are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under
               different models of population structure and show how population
               substructure complicates inference. The results lead to
               simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace
               F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for
               estimating population divergence.",

              Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to
              east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific
              Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the
              draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual
              (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth
              of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern
              human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome
              belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high
              frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European
              hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to
              modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native
              American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that
              MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically
              closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close
              affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related
              to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly
              distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore,
              we estimate that 14 to 38\% of Native American ancestry may
              originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is
              likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American
              ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the
              diversification of Native American populations in the New World.
              Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors
              could explain why several crania from the First Americans have
              been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do
              not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another
              south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately
              17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures
              as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by
              humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal
              that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native
              Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as
              commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First
              Americans.",

              subsequently admixed into many modern populations in the region,

  author    = "Martin, Simon H and Davey, John W and Jiggins, Chris D",
  abstract  = "Several methods have been proposed to test for introgression
               across genomes. One method tests for a genome-wide excess of
               shared derived alleles between taxa using Patterson's D
               statistic, but does not establish which loci show such an excess
               or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral
               population structure. Several recent studies have extended the
               use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions,
               rather than genome-wide. Here, we use simulations and
               whole-genome data from Heliconius butterflies to investigate the
               behavior of D in small genomic regions. We find that D is
               unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when
               effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster
               in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we
               propose a related statistic ƒ(d), a modified version of a
               statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide
               fraction of admixture. ƒ(d) is not subject to the same biases as
               D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci. Finally, we
               show that both D and ƒ(d) outliers tend to cluster in regions of
               low absolute divergence (d(XY)), which can confound a recently
               proposed test for differentiating introgression from shared
               ancestral variation at individual loci.",

              lcMLkin, NgsRelate, KIN, and READ, which differ in their input,
              IBD-estimation methods and statistical approaches. We used
              pedigree and ancient genome sequence simulations to evaluate
              these tools when only a limited number (1K to 50K) of shared SNPs
              (with minor allele frequency $\geq$0.01) are available. The
              performance of all four tools was comparable using $\geq$20K
              SNPs. We found that first-degree related pairs can be accurately
              classified even with 1K SNPs, with 85\% F1 scores using READ and
              96\% using NgsRelate or lcMLkin. Distinguishing third-degree
              relatives from unrelated pairs or second-degree relatives was
              also possible with high accuracy (F1 >90\%) with 5K SNPs using
              NgsRelate and lcMLkin, while READ and KIN showed lower success
              (69\% and 79\%, respectively). Meanwhile, noise in population
              allele frequencies and inbreeding (first cousin mating) led to
              deviations in kinship coefficients, with different sensitivities

  abstract = "Estimation of genetically related individuals is playing an
              increasingly important role in the ancient DNA field. In recent
              years, the numbers of sequenced individuals from single sites
              have been increasing, reflecting a growing interest in
              understanding the familial and social organisation of ancient
              populations. Although a few different methods have been
              specifically developed for ancient DNA, namely to tackle issues
              such as low-coverage homozygous data, they require a
              0.1-1$\times$ minimum average genomic coverage per analysed pair
              of individuals. Here we present an updated version of a method
              that enables estimates of 1st and 2nd-degrees of relatedness with
              as little as 0.026$\times$ average coverage, or around 18,000
              SNPs from 1.3 million aligned reads per sample with average
              length of 62 bp-four times less data than 0.1$\times$ coverage at
              similar read lengths. By using simulated data to estimate false
              positive error rates, we further show that a threshold even as
              low as 0.012$\times$, or around 4000 SNPs from 600,000 reads,
              will always show 1st-degree relationships as related. Lastly, by
              applying this method to published data, we are able to identify
              previously undocumented relationships using individuals that had
              been excluded from prior kinship analysis due to their very low
              coverage. This methodological improvement has the potential to
              enable relatedness estimation on ancient whole genome shotgun
              data during routine low-coverage screening, and therefore improve
              project management when decisions need to be made on which

              investigated to a large extent. Knowing the genetic kinship of
              historic and prehistoric individuals would give important
              insights into social structures of ancient and historic cultures.
              Most archaeogenetic research concerning kinship has been
              restricted to uniparental markers, while studies using
              genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons
              between populations. Applications which infer the degree of
              relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically
              require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous
              DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA
              (aDNA) makes the application of such tools unfeasible for most
              archaeological samples. To infer family relationships for
              degraded samples, we developed the software READ (Relationship

In combination with contextual data, reconstructed pedigrees can be used to infer possible kinship practices in prehistoric populations. However, standard methods to estimate biological relatedness from genome sequence data cannot be applied to low coverage sequence data, such as are common in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies. Critically, a statistically robust method for assessing and quantifying the confidence of a classification of a specific degree of relatedness for a pair of individuals, using low coverage genome data, is lacking.In this paper we present the R-package BREADR (Biological RElatedness from Ancient DNA in R), which leverages the so-called pairwise mismatch rate, calculated on optimally-thinned genome-wide pseudo-haploid sequence data, to estimate genetic relatedness up to the second degree, assuming an underlying binomial distribution. BREADR also returns a posterior probability for each degree of relatedness, from identical twins/same individual, first-degree, second-degree or {\textquotedblleft}unrelated{\textquotedblright} pairs, allowing researchers to quantify and report the uncertainty, even for particularly low-coverage data. We show that this method accurately recovers degrees of relatedness for sequence data with coverage as low as 0.04X using simulated data, and then compare the performance of BREADR on empirical data from Bronze Age Iberian human sequence data. The BREADR package is designed for pseudo-haploid genotype data, common in aDNA studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
